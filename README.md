# TM-JS-Imgur-Redirect/Bypass
Redirects/bypass away from NSFW warning and login page on imgur.  Redirects by appending "/embed?pub=true" to the end of the url, which bypasses the login for a direct view.  This works for albums, and animated files, but does not let you download all.

To be honest this isn't particularly clean, and there's extra stuff I wish I could do but I'm not clever enough for that.  (figure out a download all option, make the new redirect page dark)

That said I might come back to this to try to fix those in the future.
